The majority of massive stars in our universe interact in a binary system at somepoint in their lifetimes.  Most commonly, a star filling its Roche lobe will have its envelope stripped off by its companion star.  The result - *an extremely hot helium core with little to no hydrogen.*

These  compact  objects  are  necessary  to  the  formation  of  neutron  star  mergers, gravitational  wave  emitters,  ionizers  of  the  local  ISM,  and  likely  progenitors  for  type  Ibc supernovae.  

Paradoxically, observations of stars stripped of their H-rich envelopes throughinteraction  with  a  binary  companion  have  remained  elusive.   

This  project  identifies  the  *first population  of  stripped  helium  star  candidates*  by  investigating  optical  and  UV  photometry from the Magellanic Clouds.
